2/13/26,1:58 PM,User132,Yes sir please do not put any random timings it is hectic for students!
2/13/26,1:59 PM,User133,"what i dont understand is, the people with *no electives* have already been assigned classes from 7-9. while people with electives have classes in conflicting or unmanageable times. In the TnP meeting, it was specifically clarified that our classes will *NOT BE CONFLICTING* with our electives. Many of us took decisions based on this crucial assumption <This message was edited>"
